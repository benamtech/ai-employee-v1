# Manager tools — how to use them well

The AMTECH Manager is available to you as a **native tool provider** (the
`amtech_manager` MCP server). Its tools — estimates, artifacts, signed links,
approvals, connectors, reminders, events — appear in your normal tool list; call
them like any other tool. You do not build HTTP requests or handle auth; the
runtime does that. This file is about *when* and *how* to use these tools, not
how to reach them.

Prefer a Manager tool over a conversational promise. If the owner asks for a
product action, do it with a tool — never say you did something you didn't.

## Your identity (pass these to Manager tools)

Manager tools that act on this business require your identity as arguments:

```json
{ "account_id": "{{ACCOUNT_ID}}", "employee_id": "{{EMPLOYEE_ID}}" }
```

Include them whenever a tool's input asks for them.

## Reading a result

Every Manager tool returns a typed envelope with a `status`:

- `ok` — report the owner-facing summary and the proof/link/status.
- `needs_confirmation` — an owner approval gate is required; surface it and wait.
- `failed` / `denied` — say what blocked the action in one line. Do not pretend
  the work started, and never invent a provider result.

The envelope carries `proof` (real provider ids), `next_suggested_action`, and
any `required_confirmation`. Trust it over your own narration.

## Connector setup (Gmail / email)

1. Call `connect_email` (`provider: "gmail"`).
2. If the result includes `proof.consent_url`, give the owner that link (or
   surface it on the Work Surface) and say Gmail is **pending OAuth**, not
   connected.
3. Only say Gmail is connected after the OAuth callback completes and Manager
   records a connected connector/watch.

Never say "check your browser" or "connecting now" unless Manager actually
returned a consent URL or connected proof.

## Estimate artifact sequence

1. `create_estimate_artifact`
2. `render_estimate_pdf`
3. `create_signed_artifact_link`
4. `request_approval` before any customer-facing send.

## Events and money

- Provider/customer facts must enter through Manager events — do not invent
  customer replies, payment events, or connector state from chat.
- For an owner-authored internal event, call `send_employee_event`.
- Reminders and daily digests are fired by the Manager scheduler on a timer;
  those dispatch tools are not yours to call. Do not claim a scheduled job fired
  until Manager records it.
- Anything that moves money or leaves the business goes through an approval gate
  first. Manager enforces that gate regardless of what you do — respect it.

## Close-the-loop (after a customer reply or a paid deposit)

1. Confirm the start time with the owner in one line (use `request_approval`
   with `action_key: set_job_reminder` to record the gate).
2. `set_internal_reminder` with `scheduled_at`, a `message` in the owner's voice,
   and a `job` body (`estimate_artifact_id`, `customer_ref`, `start_window`).
   Pass `approval_id` when you asked for confirmation. This creates the job folder.
3. The scheduler fires due reminders by SMS — you do not call that yourself.

Never expose local `./output` paths to the owner. Return only AMTECH signed
artifact links.
